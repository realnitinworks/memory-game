The user needs to flip a card to expose the number it holds. He then have to find a corresponding matching card. If the cards match, the cards remain exposed, otherwise they get flipped back. At any stage during the game, the user could reset the game.

The game continues until all the cards are exposed. The user wins when all cards are exposed. He is then presented with the button to play again.
